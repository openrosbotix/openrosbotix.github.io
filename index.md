## Welcome to OpenROSbotix
OpenROSbotix is a github organization created by me, Patrick Weber. I'm a hobbyist robotic engineer and want to use this organization to share my robots with 
interested people. The main target groupy are maker, hobbyist robotic engineers, students and other people interested in building their own robots.

All robots use ROS, the robot operating system. To build the robots, no special machines or equipment should be needed. You need a 3D printer for sure.
Also you need some knowledge about soldering, electronics and software development.

Is is a hobby project, I can't spend hundrets of hours per week here. So be aware that I can provide only minimal support (if even) and in most cases, you're on your own.
If you don't feel comfortable with that (and I totally understand this), please have a look to other robot builds out there. 

## Notes
This project is still under development and far away from complete. So please check for updates regulary.

## DISCLAIMER
This project comes without any warranty. It is still under development and things will change. Also as my builds are not complete so far,
files may not fit together as planned. You build at your own risk.
